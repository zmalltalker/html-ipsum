HTML-ipsum
Basic things which everyone should know
==========

This Textmate bundle is inspired by (a ripoff, rather), of http://html-ipsum.com/. It adds Textmate snippets for inserting random HTML markup into a document of your choice


Installation
------------

In your terminal go into the Textmate bundles directory:

    cd ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles

Checkout the bundle from Gitorious:

    git clone http://gitorious.org/html-ipsum/mainline.git HTML-ipsum.tmbundle

Or, if you prefer, from Github:

    git clone git://github.com/zmalltalker/html-ipsum.git HTML-ipsum.tmbundle

You can now enjoy the snippets in Textmate.

* Long paragraph: (`longpara`)
